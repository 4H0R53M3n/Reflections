When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	-When you're working on a project from multiple computers or multiple people making commits.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	-You should make pull requests manually so that git doesn't override work on your local branch and so that you don't have experimental code on the remote repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	-Forks clone a repository of another person on github into github. Clones copy a branch from another repository, and branches are just the different code pathes of a repositories remote.
