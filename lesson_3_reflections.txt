When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	-When you're working on a project from multiple computers or multiple people making commits.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	-You should make pull requests manually so that git doesn't override work on your local branch and so that you don't have experimental code on the remote repository
